### Task

Create a webapp that allows a user to answer questions. Once the user has finished answering all questions, present
the user with their score. The webapp needs to follow the below requirements.

- The user must see only one question at a time. The webapp should transition from one question to another and not show all questions at once.
- It must be written in typescript and react.
- Must have a countdown clock that when the time is exceeded removes the current question on the page with some text informing the user their time is up

### Boilerplate

If you wish, you can use this project as a starting point. It uses vite so you can write react components right away and has
some dummy questions in the public directory. You should be able to make a http request in order to grab these.

#### To Get Started

1. `$ npm install `
2. `$ npm run dev`

### What we are looking for

- Good code design choices and understanding of typescript and react principles
- Code readability
- We are mainly looking at the features that have been implemented rather than the visual design
